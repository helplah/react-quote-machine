# react-quote-machine
This was my first time deploying a single-page React app. Phew it was tough, but I did it. 

In the master branch, the code were used in the development environment prior to `npm run deploy`.

The gh-pages branch contain all the code that belong in the production environment. It is minified and optimised, and lastly deployed.

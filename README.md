# react-quote-machine
This was my first time deploying a single-page React app. Phew it was tough, but I did it. 

I learnt and gained experience using create-react-app boilerplate, because I was using some other react boilerplate that didn't have build in the script. I look forward to creating more complex app using React.

In the master branch, the code were used in the development environment prior to `npm run deploy`.

The gh-pages branch contain all the code that belong in the production environment. It is minified and optimised, and lastly deployed.
